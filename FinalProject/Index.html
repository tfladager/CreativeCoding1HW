            In reviewing the possibilities of what this final project could be, I stumbled across 
            Steve's Makerspace on YouTube. He creates generative art with coding. It appears that he 
            has a static object - in this particular video, it was a tree silhouette - and the background 
            is filled in with random shapes and color palettes. It is in a set pattern, similar to
            brush strokes and this one reminded me of Van Gogh's Starry night.

            I also discovered several optional code patterns that showed alternate ways of 
            varying position, size, color, etc., which I played with a bit in the module 13 extra credit
            portion.

            I will try to recreate a prairie scene with the similar idea of having an "area"
            for the wheat fields, an area for the sky, and possibly a highway running through it 
            that is static.

            When the user presses play, different color palettes will be used with multiple tiny
            various shapes to fill the field and sky to appear as if they are part of creating
            the art.

            Anticipated problems include delineating the areas, adding differnet areas of color and shapes
            to those areas in a random, clickable action.

            Defining pleasing color palettes and various shapes that are in themselves "artsy," will 
            also be a unique challenge.

            If I can pull all  of that off, I want to also add music that could also possibly challenge
            with the click of the mouse.

            My work plan is to use the next 11 days, with at least 1-2 hours per day to work on this project.
            I have had difficulties in this course and find myself going back through the modules as I work 
            through the assignments. It is intimidating to me and therefore it can seem overwhelming, which 
            is why I will start after submitting this assignment. 

            I have also looked at various different artist/coder's works and know what I want to do, which is exciting
            for me. That will help. Working through the extra credit modules has given me new ideas and time to 
            learn more skills.
